       "'--- Content for \\'Hackathon event structure and logistics\\' ---\\n### BarCamp ###\\nBarCamp is an international network of user-generated conferences primarily focused on technology and the web. They are open, participatory workshop-events, the content of which is provided by participants.  The first BarCamps focused on early stage web applications, and were related to open-source technologies, social software, and open data formats.\\nThe format has also been used for a variety of other topics, including public transit, health care, education, and political organizing. The BarCamp format has also been adapted for specific industries like banking, education, real estate and social media.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nThe name BarCamp is a playful allusion to the event\\'s origins, with reference to the programmer slang term, foobar: BarCamp arose as an open-to-the-public alternative to Foo Camp, which is an annual invitation-only participant-driven conference hosted by Tim O\\'Reilly.\\nThe first BarCamp was held in Palo Alto, California, from August 19–21, 2005, in the offices of Socialtext. According to participant Tantek Celik, it was organized in less than one week, from concept to event. In addition to Celik, Chris Messina, Matthew Mullenweg, Andy Smith, Ryan King, and Eris Stassi have been described as founders of BarCamp.\\nSince then, BarCamps have been held in over 350 cities around the world, in North America, South America, Africa, Europe, the Middle East, Australasia and Asia. Attendees have often travelled internationally to attend BarCamps.\\nTo mark the first anniversary of BarCamp, BarCampEarth was held in multiple locations worldwide on August 25–27, 2006.  Wired described the second anniversary meeting BarCampBlock (Palo Alto, August 18–19, 2007) as \"BarCamp Geeks Celebrate Two Years of Organized Chaos.\"\\nIn January 2013, the largest recorded BarCamp took place in Yangon, Myanmar (Burma), with 6,400 attendees and free internet provided by the government.\\n\\n\\n== Structure and participatory process ==\\nUnlike traditional conference formats, both BarCamps and FooCamps have a self-organizing character. The organizers of a BarCamp may choose the theme for the meeting, but those who choose to attend are in charge of the schedule. Attendees schedule sessions by writing on a whiteboard or putting a Post-It note on a \\'grid\\' of sessions. Those giving sessions are discouraged from using the sessions for promotion. BarCamps are often organized largely through the web; anyone can initiate a BarCamp using the BarCamp wiki.\\n\\nAlthough the format is loosely structured, there are rules at BarCamp. All attendees are encouraged to present or facilitate a session or otherwise contribute to the event. Everyone is also asked to share information and experiences of the event via public web channels, including blogs, photo sharing, social bookmarking, Twitter, wikis, and IRC. This encouragement to share is a deliberate change from the \"off-the-record by default\" and \"no recordings\" rules at many invite-only participant driven conferences. It also turns a physical, face-to-face event into a \\'hybrid event\\' which enables remote online engagement with BarCamp participants.\\n\\n\\n== Hosting and attending ==\\nVenues typically provide basic services. Free network access, usually WiFi, is crucial. Following the model of Foo Camp, the venue also makes space for the attendees, or BarCampers, to literally camp out overnight. Thus, BarCamps rely on securing sponsorship, ranging from the venue and network access to beverages and food.\\nAttendance is typically free of charge and generally restricted only by space constraints. Participants are typically encouraged to sign up in advance.\\n\\n\\n== Historical precedents ==\\nHistorically, BarCamp was based on the structure of Foo Camp, but with the requirement that participation should be open to all. (Foo Camp, an early unconference, was organized by Tim O\\'Reilly and Sara Winge; Winge had been a student of Harrison Owen.\\nThis form of self-organized user generated conferences is also related to hackers\\' meetings in Europe, especially those nearer to anarchism and autonomism, happening since the \\'90s in Temporary Autonomous Zones or other occupied places. However, BarCamps lack the political motivations and are actually quite integrated with the mainstream ICT industry, often getting substantial sponsorships from major corporations.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nCafé Philosophique\\nHackathon\\nKnowledge cafe\\nStixCamp\\nSuperHappyDevHouse\\nSweden Social Web Camp\\nTeachMeet\\nTribe (internet)\\nDataMeet\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nBarCamp.org (website) (archived 2 November 2010)\\nHart, Kim (October 20, 2008). \"Twittering Types Share Ideas Offline\".

It was organized by SAPO which, besides a news media brand, was also an internet-focused R&D division of Portugal Telecom at the time.Codebits had a 48-hour hackathon at its core, but the number of talks and entertainment activities increased steadily over the years, along with the number of seats, attracting an increasing number of international attendees and speakers. At this point it was as much of a festival as it was a conference.\\nIn 2015, Portugal Telecom was acquired by Altice, SAPO\\'s mission changed, and Codebits was discontinued after seven editions. In 2016, the Codebits format was revived outside SAPO under the name Pixels Camp. Pixels Camp ran for three more editions until the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\n\\n== Format ==\\nInitially inspired by Yahoo! Hack Day, Codebits lasted for three non-stop days and nights, with many participants choosing to eat and sleep on site. Its core was a 48-hour hackathon but also included dozens of talks during the day, as well as several entertainment activities in the evenings.\\nCodebits was free for all participants, including plenty of food and drinks. Active recruiting inside the premises was disallowed, and there were little commercial undertones apart from a few product announcements during the opening keynotes.\\nThe number of seats was limited and potential attendees had to undergo a short screening process in order to secure a ticket. The screening was meant to ensure that most, if not all, attendees had a suitable technical background or creative skills related to the event\\'s theme. Applicants such as those in marketing and recruiting were usually rejected.\\nCodebits always opened on a Thursday and had its first morning composed of general keynotes from the organizing company and its partners/sponsors, plus general information about the hackathon and satellite activities. The hackathon began in that same afternoon and ended on Saturday morning, with that day\\'s afternoon reserved for project presentations, voting, and the event\\'s closing ceremony.\\n\\n\\n=== 48-hour Hackathon ===\\n\\nIn the hackathon, teams were free to propose whatever project they wanted, software or hardware, with no suggested themes or subject restrictions.\\nOn Saturday, teams were required to present their projects on stage. They had 90 seconds to do it and the audience voted (thumbs up/down) between each presentation. The selection of winning teams was a combination of the audience votes and the votes of a jury panel. The weighting between the audience and jury votes varied from edition to edition.\\n\\n\\n=== Talks ===\\nTalks were mostly self-proposed by participants, but there were also a number of talks from invited speakers. Self-proposed talks followed a public process where all proposals were visible to everyone for comments and suggestions, but the final selection was made by the organizers.\\n\\n\\n=== Evening Activities ===\\nSatellite activities were usually held in the evenings. These activities usually combined entertainment with some element of geek culture. They were initially meant to relieve some pressure from the hackathon, but gained a life of their own over time. Some of the most prominent activities were:\\n\\n\\n==== Quiz Show ====\\nSince 2008, in the four weeks before the event, participants had to solve about one challenge per-week to qualify for the quiz show. The challenges included image enigmas, treasure hunts, code golf contests, among others. They all shared a reasonably high level of difficulty and required a fair knowledge of tech-related culture and motivation. 32 qualified participants then went on stage on Friday after dinner time for a few rounds of questions, mostly about science, technology, and geek trivia.\\n\\n\\n==== Security Competition ====\\nThe security competition followed a capture-the-flag (CTF) model. Participants were asked to answer questions and solve challenges related to cybersecurity (such as identifying and exploiting vulnerable applications purposely built for the competition) in order to obtain tokens (flags) that translated into points. The competition took place on Thursday evening and lasted over three hours. Like the quiz show, participants had to qualify by solving a few challenges in the weeks before the event.\\n\\n\\n==== Nuclear Tacos ====\\nThe \"nuclear\" tacos competition involved eating ultra-spicy tacos as fast as possible over a few rounds of increasing spiciness. It started in 2010 as just a dare to participants but eventually evolved into a proper competition. It usually took place on Friday evening before the quiz show.\\n\\n\\n==== Other Activities ====\\nOther activities included a Presentation Karaoke, retro-gaming displays, and workshops on soldering, 3D printing, lockpicking, etc. Earlier editions also included music concerts (e.g. WrayGunn in 2007, Pornophonique in 2009).\\n\\n\\n=== Makers and Hardware ===\\nCodebits wasn\\'t just about software and the Internet, the hardware and maker culture was also a significant part of it. There were workshops on electronics from the start and, starting in 2010, there was also significant space dedicated to hardware project showcases and workshops (the \"Hardware Den\").\\n\\n\\n== Editions ==\\n2007 — November 13–15 at Gare Marítima de Alcântara, Lisbon — 400 attendees\\n2008 — November 13–15 at LX Factory, Lisbon — 500 attendees\\n2009 — December 3–5 at Cordoaria Nacional, Lisbon — 600 attendees\\n2010 — November 11–13 at Pavilhão Atlântico, Lisbon — 700 attendees\\n2011 — November 10–12 at Pavilhão Atlântico, Lisbon — 800 attendees\\n2012 — November 16–18 at Pavilhão Atlântico, Lisbon — 800 attendees\\n2014 — April 10–12 at MEO Arena, Lisbon — 900 attendees\\nIn 2013, Codebits was planned to happen simultaneously in São Paulo and Lisbon delaying both events due to logistics issues at the Brazilian venue. Meanwhile, the latter was hit by fire (unrelated to Codebits), which forced an out-of-season Lisbon-only event in April 2014.\\n\\n\\n== Reboot as Pixels Camp ==\\n\\nIn 2016, a team composed mostly of SAPO ex-employees rebooted the event under the name Pixels Camp while keeping the format virtually unchanged.\\nPixels Camp had three editions. In March 2020, a fourth edition was already in the very last stages of preparation when the COVID-19 pandemic forced its postponement to later that year. The organization remained active and conducted several online activities over that period, but Pixels Camp v4.0 ended up being officially canceled in mid-September.\\nPixels Camp was organized by Bright Pixel (a startup incubator and accelerator part of Sonae group) and financed with the help of sponsorships. It has been informally reported that any future Pixels Camp editions, should they happen, would be organized independently with a financing model still to be defined. As of late 2023, no definite plans are known.\\n\\n\\n=== Differences to Codebits ===\\nIn Pixels Camp, sponsor pitches replaced product announcements during the opening morning. On stage, sponsors suggested themes related to their own areas of activity for the hackathon. Participants were not required to cover any of the suggested themes in their projects, but often did.\\nUnlike Codebits, Pixels Camp had significant floor area dedicated to sponsors. Active recruiting was still disallowed, but there was an implicit understanding that participants could approach sponsor at their booths to ask about available job offerings.\\nThe increased reliance on sponsorships and the organizing company\\'s incubator business moved the Pixels Camp hackathon closer to the startup ecosystem. Even though its rules were unchanged from Codebits, participants were more likely to present projects around business ideas rather than projects focused mostly on raw creativity and technical ability.\\nOutside of the hackathon, Pixels Camp continued the trend of increased focus on self-proposed talks and e...

The goal of the program was to demonstrate rapid development and fielding of secure mobile apps on the battlefield. With its agile and user-centric approach, the DARPA program specifically addressed the limitations of the slow requirements-centric software development cycle followed by many Army programs of record.\\nThe TransApps program created a rapid development and enhancements process within the tactical environment, and embedded a small team of trainers and developers within the deployed military units in Afghanistan, the program also tackled a wide range of issues related to hardware and software security, agile map-imagery distribution and enhancements, combat radio integration, disconnected and connected users, and third party app testing and integration. Unlike a typical DARPA program at the time, the program brought together multiple contractors and Government personnel in a co-located incubator-like environment during the program\\'s lifetime.\\nBy the end of the program, roughly fifty apps were deployed in a secure operational environment.\\n\\n\\n== Timeline ==\\nThe TransApps Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) was released in March 2010. The BAA noted a range of potential use cases, including tactical battlefield applications, as well as humanitarian missions and disaster recovery. The TransApps program was devised and initially managed by Dr. Mari Maeda – developer of a previous DARPA project, the Tactical Ground Reporting System (TIGR).  Many of the existing requirements of the TIGR application provided the foundation for the follow-on baseline requirements for TransApps. These included a renewed emphasis on user-centric development, as well as a focus on security, functionality under limited connectivity, and a broader suite of applications.\\nTransApps was initially awarded in September 2010 to the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI), with the focus on building a secure, mobile app store.  This was followed a few years later with a contract awarded to Metronome to build out the app store.   The app store, simply referred to as the “Marketplace” emphasizes a flexible and extensible environment to meet a wide range of mission needs, within a collaborative development environment to optimize DARPA’s investment.  Moreover, it serves as a key component in innovating the acquisition process, expediting the time from application development to mission use. Over time, Metronome has expanded the marketplace to focus on mobile and cyber security as well.\\nWhile there has been much success, TransApps initially relied upon the Dell Streak, which was discontinued in 2011. Since then, the TransApps platform has adjusted to function on a range of hardware, including Motorola Xoom, Galaxy Note, and Samsung S4. In addition to security, additional emphasis has also been placed on usability and visualization via the iWarrior SBIR that falls under TransApps.  In 2012, TransApps was identified as one of the top 25 C4ISR breakthroughs of the year.  In April 2013, DARPA awarded a contract to GXM Consulting to continue to expand the functionality and robustness of the smartphones.\\nTransApps not only has focused on security abroad, but has also employed the capabilities domestically. TransApps supported first response and law enforcement personnel during the 2013 Presidential Inauguration.   That same year, TransApps also was present at the Boston Marathon, providing similar support for first responders, and did so again at the 2014 Boston Marathon. During FY2014, TransApps is working with the Army Nett Warrior Program to fully transition the project to the Army as a program of record.\\n\\n\\n== The TransApps Ecosystem: DARPA-Hard Innovations ==\\nThe TransApps program pursued novel functionality and security for the operational user, but also pursued a new acquisition paradigm to significantly decrease the time and money from development to operational use. TransApps was required to create a modern mobile capability within the constraints of a tactical operating environment. The applications are the most visible feature, and required and benefited from constant feedback from the user community. However, the vast majority of the innovations dealt both with expediting the acquisition process to deliver timely capabilities for the warfighter, as well as handling the network/security and operations/logistics within a tactical environment.\\n\\n\\n=== Altering the Acquisition Paradigm ===\\nThe normal DARPA acquisition process involves three to four months of selecting a winning proposal, an additional three to four months to negotiate the contract, and then continuing with the same vendor for three to five years. In contrast, the TransApps program sought to replicate best practices from the commercial world, including an integrated and collaborative working environment indicative of a start-up, and quickly moving from development to mission use.\\nThe TransApps program pursued a “warfighter empowered acquisition” mentality to field capabilities faster and in sync with current warfighter requirements. TransApps sought to establish a new acquisition model that can circumvent the standard bureaucratic delays with developing and fielding capabilities. This new business model required navigating both technological as well as bureaucratic hurdles to quickly field the new applications. In 2012, Maeda, then the deputy director, Defense Sciences Office at DARPA said, \"Today, we have 3-to-4000 users in an ongoing program in Afghanistan using a secure, robust Android handheld device. We roll out new capabilities every three to four months, from new apps to new server capabilities.\"\\nTransApps not only pursued a new model for acquisition, but also represented a shift in development processes, one that entailed placing the engineers in the users’ environment. In 2012, a TransApps team, including computer scientists, spent nine months in Afghanistan to gather user requirements, and develop and test applications. They also were able to reach back to the larger TransApps team in the United States to expedite development and quickly provide capabilities to tactical users.\\nInstead of fielding capabilities at the end of the development process, the TransApps pilot efforts gathered immediate feedback, identifying quickly which requirements were met, technical bugs in devices, as well as ideas for the next development cycles based explicitly on user feedback. DARPA has worked with the U.S. Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command’s Communications-Electronics Center (CERDEC) to ensure downrange support and mission-driven development. As Doran Michels, the DARPA Program Manager in charge of TransApps, explained in a December 2013 press release, “We wanted soldiers to drive the development of the applications so we knew the apps could evolve in real time with dynamic mission requirements.”\\nLess than a year after awarding the TransApp program, a pilot program was underway with the 3rd Brigade of the 10th Mountain Division in Afghanistan to test the mobile devices running the Android OS. In addition to testing the security, the TransApps team also developed a dozen applications by mid-Fall 2011. This pilot effort helped harden the requirement for functionality within disconnected as well as connected environments.  The development process can be viewed as a ‘wireless to the edge’ approach, tightly integrating with potential tactical users. This has provided the opportunity to ensure usability and applicability across an array of use cases. The initial requirements focused on high-resolution mobile imagery and additional ways to interact with and navigate the geospatial applications. Once these initial requirements were satisfied, the users immediately began identifying and asking for additional functionality. In many instances, users ident...

Ahuja as Innovative Scheduling, Inc. The company headquarters is situated on 10 acres in Dallas, Texas, and additional offices are located in Yerevan, Armenia; Bangalore, India; and Perth, Australia.\\nOptym provides transportation software and specializes in the optimization, simulation and analytics of transportation and logistics for railroad, trucking, airline and mining industries. The company clients include 5 of the top 10 LTL carriers and several other clients across railroad, air freight, and full-truckload such as Southwest Airlines, Komatsu, BNSF Railway, BHP, Norfolk Southern, Greyhound, and more.  \\nOptym was founded by researcher and academic Dr. Ravindra K. Ahuja in 2000 as Innovative Scheduling, Inc., which rebranded as Optym in 2014.\\nBetween 2004 and 2015, Optym was located at the Gainesville Technology Entrepreneurship Center (GTEC), a Santa Fe College-led business incubator. In 2015, the company moved its facility to the three-building Hillside Office Park off Tower Road in order to foster rapid expansion and hiring.\\n\\n\\n== Financing ==\\nOptym obtained its first Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant of $500,000 from the National Science Foundation (NSF) in 2004 to develop commercial software, specifically to build a decision support system addressing railroad blocking problems for CSX Transportation. It allowed Optym to hire its first set of full-time employees, including Krishna C. Jha, Wei Huang and Arvind Kumar, all of whom completed their Ph.D.’s at the University of Florida under Ahuja\\'s guidance.\\nIn 2005, Optym received its Phase II SBIR grant to build a decision support system for train\\nscheduling, and BNSF Railway provided a matching grant. These two grants, plus the  licensing revenues from the product funded by the first NSF grant, provided continued funding for the research and development of optimization technologies for railroads. That year, Optym began building and commercializing its software and investing profits into the research and development of new products.\\n\\n\\n== Expansion ==\\nOptym\\'s Armenia office opened in 2007 in the capital city of Yerevan with the goal of conducting research and development of innovative IT techniques. This allowed Optym to package optimization and simulation engines into desktop, web and map-based applications. The Armenia office currently has about 50 developers who specialize in databases, applications and UI development technologies.\\nOptym started its development center in Bangalore, India, in 2013 with intentions to benefit from a large talent pool of computer engineers in optimization, machine learning, data analytics, data warehousing and software architecture. This location gave Optym a regional base to accommodate its growing list of global customers.\\nIn 2014, Optym\\'s office in Perth, Australia, opened to serve local mining clients, including BHP.\\nIn 2017, Optym expanded its headquarters facility in Gainesville, Florida, by an additional 10,000 square feet to accommodate a growing workforce and expanding slate of projects. Due to rapid growth, Optym doubled its Gainesville team from approximately 60 employees in 2014 to 120 employees in 2017.\\nIn 2020, Optym moved its corporate headquarters to Dallas, Texas, but still maintains an active presence in Florida.\\n\\n\\n== Rebranding ==\\nOptym\\'s current corporate identity is the result of a rebranding strategy initiated in 2014; Innovative Scheduling, Inc. changed its name to Optym, which is derived from the word “optimization,” supposedly to better reflect the expanding range of work, both in the products and services offered and the industries served. The rebranding effort also included a new logo and the new tagline, “Live Efficiently”.\\n\\n\\n== Corporate affairs ==\\n\\n\\n=== Expertise ===\\nOptym combines business intelligence, which includes harvesting big data, data visualization and advanced data analytics, with employees’ knowledge as industry-specific experts as well as technical experts in operations research, information technology, data analytics, computer science and project management. Optym\\'s team is adaptive and agile in developing and delivering complex network optimization capabilities.\\nApplication developers create desktop and web applications, as well as mobile applications for iOS, Android and Windows platforms.\\nA close relationship between Optym and the University of Florida has resulted in the company frequently hiring former undergraduate and graduate students as interns and full-time employees.\\n\\n\\n=== Leadership ===\\nDr. Ravindra K. Ahuja is the founder and current CEO of Optym.\\nDr. Krishna C. Jha is Executive Vice President of Optym and CEO of Optym Rail. Jha joined Ahuja in 2000 as his doctoral student and transitioned to working with Optym as one of the company\\'s first team members in 2004. Jha focuses on the design and development of algorithms that solve real-life problems in scheduling, transportation and logistics, such as train scheduling, railroad blocking and crew scheduling.\\nDr. Wei Huang is Vice President – System Architecture at Optym and was one of Optym\\'s first team members, having joined the company in 2004. He utilizes his academic experience to develop large-scale optimization models and guide Optym\\'s software architecture.\\nRenzo Vaccari is Senior Vice President – Airline Solutions at Optym. He works closely with Southwest Airlines to develop and implement Amadeus SkyMAX and SkySYM by Optym.\\nDr. Arvind Kumar is Optym\\'s Managing Director –  India Operations and spearheads Optym\\'s growth in the Asia-Pacific region. He works on Optym\\'s core products to automate and optimize railroad and locomotive scheduling.\\nDr. Arthur Ghulyan joined Optym in 2016 as Executive Director – Armenia Operations.\\n\\n\\n=== Convergence conference ===\\nOptym hosted its first invitation-only Convergence conference in February 2015, providing an opportunity for leaders in the transportation and logistics industries to exchange ideas, learn more about each other\\'s challenges and discuss upcoming products. Sixty executives from major rail, airline and trucking companies met at Optym\\'s Gainesville, Florida, headquarters to discuss how to increase efficiency within the transportation and logistics industries.\\nDuring the second Convergence conference in Orlando, Florida, in April 2016, 120 executives from 15 countries and 50 companies, including American Airlines, United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, JetBlue, Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines; Amazon.com freight, FedEx Freight and UPS Freight; and BNSF Railway, CSX Transportation and Norfolk Southern Railway, met to discuss the conference\\'s theme of Decision Automation. \\nThe third Convergence conference was held in Miami, Florida, in September 2017 and focused on the theme of Decision Optimization.\\n\\n\\n=== Hackathon ===\\nOptym Armenia was the general sponsor and co-organizer of the Smarter Transportation Data Hackathon, which was a 24-hour event held in Yerevan, Armenia, on April 16, 2017. \\n\\n\\n=== Awards and recognition ===\\nOptym was one of two finalists for Best Tech Company at the Gainesville Area Chamber of Commerce\\'s Business of the Year Awards in 2015.\\n\\n\\n== Products and services ==\\n\\n\\n=== Sky ===\\nFlight disruption is expected to become an increasingly expensive operational problem for airlines, airports and hotels to solve, motivating airline companies to invest in working with technology companies, such as Optym, to address disruption management.\\nIn 2016, Optym and Amadeus IT Group entered into a long-term partnership to optimize Amadeus\\'s flight scheduling, utilize its global network, technical sophistication and knowledge of the travel industry and unlock an additional 1-3% of current revenues, totalling millions of dollars. \\nAmadeus SKY Suite by Optym is the first system that optimizes flight times, fleet types, thru-flights and aircraft routings simultaneously instead of separately. The Amadeus SKY Suite by Optym cons...

The resource managed can be either material or informational. Examples include the management of common grazing and water rights, fisheries, and open-source software. In the case of physical resources, community management strategies are frequently employed to avoid the tragedy of the commons and to encourage sustainability.\\nIt is expected that community management allows for the management, usually of natural resources, to come from members of the community that these decisions will affect. This should allow for a better way of finding solutions that the community will find most effective since management styles are not always transferable across different regions; and this could be because of cultural, economic, or geographical differences. It is expected that the group members within this setting have the incentive to do the best they can for the community because they live in the community that benefits or suffers from the management they provide. By decentralizing the management of resources, it is also expected that the upkeep that occurs within the services provided is streamlined due to the direct link between the areas that need improvement or regular maintenance and the authority overseeing them. However, these expected benefits of community management are not what we see unfolding within communities that follow this management style.\\n\\n\\n== Common pool problem ==\\n\\nWithout proper management, a community\\'s material resources may be depleted or rendered unusable. The common pool problem is an economic situation which exists when goods are rival, but non-exclusive (See common-pool resource). Since these resources are owned in common, individuals have no private incentive to preserve them, but rather will seek to exploit them before others can derive benefit. The classic example is of fish in the ocean; anybody can harvest fish, but a fish that has been caught cannot be caught by another fisherman. Therefore, fishermen will seek to maximize their personal profit by catching as many fish as possible, which will ultimately lead to the stock being depleted. It is similar to the free rider problem in that those who do not contribute to the resource may use it without penalty, but the common pool problem is usually considered an economic \"problem\" since it will eventually lead to the exhausting of a resource. Another example of the common pool problem involves the shared use of limited internet bandwidth, such as in a university network, when the connectivity of all users is slowed by the heavy usage of a few.\\nElinor Ostrom and Oliver E. Williamson won the 2009 Nobel prize in economic science for work in this area, where they suggested that with good community management of shared resources, as found in successful firms, the \"tragedy of the commons\" can be avoided.\\n\\n\\n== Shared information resources ==\\n\\nDeveloping open-source software or other collaborative projects such as Wikipedia generally requires some form of community management, whether it involves leadership or egalitarianism. Unlike as is the case with physical resources, the sharing of information does not necessarily deplete the resource. Nonetheless, proper management may be necessary to encourage a network effect, where collaborative use actually enriches the resource, and to avoid conflict.\\nMore generally, community management designates the activity of maintaining communication, motivation, efficiency, and engagement among a group of remote individuals often only linked together by the Internet. Typically, it will contribute to the success of an open-source initiative by keeping forums alive with information, questions, and challenges, by organizing real-life events for virtual communities, or by organizing contests or hackathons to focus all efforts on a common goal. It may also be used to improve motivation and synergy in a large organization (such as a company or a public organization) by creating a sense of belonging and ensuring that members are aware of each other\\'s work. Community management requires human skills (a community manager) and the use of tools (e.g., social networks, instant messaging, resource sharing, etc.).\\n\\n\\n== Problems with Community Management ==\\nCommunity management has been a popular strategy utilized in African water management, but research has shown that Africans often don\\'t prefer this management style. Main problems of community management, specifically related to water management, consist of potential maintenance issues, population issues, money collecting issues, and a lack of community engagement.\\n\\nCommunity management can create potential maintenance issues that are resolved with less expediency and with less efficiency. This often stems as a result of having a lack of a qualified person to perform the repair or lacking a reliable way to collect money in order to hire someone to do the repair.\\nMoney collecting issues are a main problem in poorer areas. If not, everyone is paying a fee to use the resources in question, then there won\\'t be any money to make repairs when needed. This includes not paying and a lack of an efficient way to pay fees. People will not go out of their way to pay fees so a solid collection strategy is needed.\\nGeneral user fees within community managed water supply systems have been found to be not enough to keep the service operational let alone make repairs when needed. Even if citizens have the capacity to pay fees it has been found that many people simply don\\'t want to. It is suggested that health concerns about clean drinking water are not enough to create a population of users who are willing to pay user fees let alone maintenance fees when needed.\\nPopulation issues can also cause problems because community management is often more effective on a smaller scale. In other words, communities with smaller populations have an easier time developing effective systems like citizen participation, money collection, or maintenance repairs simply because it is easier to combat the problems that arrive within those areas when there is a smaller group of people affected that need help.\\nA lack of community engagement is a chronic issue that arises within community management, as well. In order for community management to be an effective strategy of management style the community must be engaged within the management system in order to reap the community benefits. Despite this, most citizens are not interested in the issues community management organizations are looking to improve, meaning these organizations are getting less input from the community which negates the point of community management.\\n\\n\\n== Methods of management ==\\n\\nA community may itself be actively developed and managed in order to promote communal activity and welfare.\\nIn some cases, the task of managing a physical resource may be delegated to a specialist professional called a community manager. Meaning members of the community are involved in the development and follow through of community development projects, which can involve acquiring the funding for projects as well as deciding what plans would be beneficial for the community and which ones would not.\\nMalawi is an example of the utilization of community management to provide water access to citizens. Malawi is a poor area that with recent governmental pushes for decentralization has led to water management becoming a community responsibility. Within Malawi boreholes are used to access water and each of these boreholes is under the control of a committee which delegates a manager for each borehole. These managers receive initial training from an official district water officer but are then left to make their own decisions regarding the upkeep of the borehole. This training has been found to be ineffective in many cases so the work of ar...

They are often run using agile software development practices, such as sprint-like design wherein computer programmers and others involved in software development, including graphic designers, interface designers, product managers, domain experts, and others collaborate intensively on engineering projects, such as software engineering.\\nThe goal of a hackathon is to create functioning software or hardware by the end of the event. Hackathons tend to have a specific focus, which can include the programming language used, the operating system, an application, an API, or the subject and the demographic group of the programmers. In other cases, there is no restriction on the type of software being created or the design of the new system.\\nIn addition to creating functional software or hardware, hackathons can help participants develop skills like problem solving, critical thinking, creativity, team work, communication and time management. Hackathons can also lead to formation of new companies, finding innovative solutions to real-world problems, or building a community around particular technology or cause.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\nThe word \"hackathon\" is a portmanteau of the words \"hack\" and \"marathon\", where \"hack\" is used in the sense of exploratory programming, not its alternate meaning as a reference to breaching computer security.\\nOpenBSD\\'s apparent first use of the term referred to a cryptographic development event held in Calgary on June 4, 1999, where ten developers came together to avoid legal problems caused due to export regulations of cryptographic software from the United States. Since then, a further three to six events per year have occurred around the world to advance development, generally on university campuses.\\nFor Sun Microsystems, the usage referred to an event at the JavaOne conference from June 15 to June 19, 1999; there John Gage challenged attendees to write a program in Java for the new Palm V using the infrared port to communicate with other people who are using Palm and register it on the Internet.\\nStarting in the mid to late 2000s, hackathons became significantly more widespread and began to be increasingly viewed by companies and venture capitalists as a way to quickly develop new software technologies, and to locate new areas for innovation and funding. Some major companies were born from these hackathons, such as GroupMe, which began as a project at a hackathon at the TechCrunch Disrupt 2010 conference; in 2011 it was acquired by Skype for $85 million. The software PhoneGap began as a project at the iPhoneDevCamp (later renamed iOSDevCamp) in 2008; the company whose engineers developed PhoneGap, Nitobi, refocused itself around PhoneGap, and Nitobi was bought by Adobe in 2011 for an undisclosed amount.\\n\\n\\n== Structure ==\\nHackathons typically start with communication via a presentation or a web page from the hosting organization that mentions the objectives, terms, and details of the hackathon. Developers register to participate in the hackathon and are qualified after the organization screens their background and skills.\\nWhen the hackathon event begins, the participating individuals or teams start their programming work. The administrator of the hackathon is typically able to answer questions and offer help when their issues come up in the event.\\nHackathons can last several hours to several days. For hackathons that last 24 hours or longer, especially competitive ones, eating is often informal, with participants often subsisting on food like pizza and energy drinks. Sometimes sleeping is informal as well, with participants sleeping on-site with sleeping bags.\\nAt the end of hackathons, there are usually a series of demonstrations in which each group presents their results. To capture the great ideas and work-in-progress often people post a video of the demonstrations, blog about results with screenshots and details, share links and progress on social media, suggest a place for open source code and generally make it possible for people to share, learn from and possibly build from the ideas generated and initial work completed.\\nThere is sometimes a contest element as well, in which a panel of judges select the winning teams, and prizes are given. At many hackathons, the judges are made up of organisers and sponsors. At BarCamp-style hackathons, that are organised by the development community, such as iOSDevCamp, the judges are usually made up of peers and colleagues in the field. Such prizes are sometimes a substantial amount of money: a social gaming hackathon at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference offered $250,000 in funding to the winners, while a controversial 2013 hackathon run by Salesforce.com had a payout of $1 million to the winners, billed as the largest-ever prize.\\n\\n\\n== Types of hackathons ==\\n\\n\\n=== For an application type ===\\nSome hackathons focus on a particular platform such as mobile apps, a desktop operating system, web development or video game development.\\nMobile app hackathons like Over the Air, held at Phoenix Park, Ireland, can see a large amount of corporate sponsorship and interest.\\nMusic Hack Day, a hackathon for music-related software and hardware applications, is a popular event, having been held over 30 times around the world since 2009. Also Music Tech Fest, a three-day interdisciplinary festival for music ideas bringing together musicians with hackers, researchers and industry, features a hackathon. Similarly, Science Hack Day, a hackathon for making things with science, has been held over 45 times in over 15 countries around the world since 2010.\\nHackathons have been held to develop applications that run on various mobile device operating systems, such as Android, iOS and MeeGo. Hackathons have also been held to develop video-based applications and computer games. Hackathons where video games are developed are sometimes called game jams.\\n\"TV Hackfest\" events have been held in both London and San Francisco, focusing mainly on social television and second screen technologies. In TV Hackfests, challenge briefs are typically submitted by content producers and brands, in the form of broadcast industry metadata or video content, while sponsors supply APIs, SDKs and pre-existing open source software code.\\nHackathons have also been used in the life sciences to advance the informatics infrastructure that supports research. The Open Bioinformatics Foundation ran two hackathons for its member projects in 2002 and 2003, and since 2010 has held 2-day \"codefests\" preceding its annual conference. The National Evolutionary Synthesis Center has co-organized and sponsored hackathons for evolutionary bioinformatics since 2006.  BioHackathon is an annual event that started in 2008 targeted at advancing standards to enable interoperable bioinformatics tools and Web services. Neuroscientists have also used hackathons to bring developers and scientists together to address issues that range from focusing on a specific information system (e.g., Neurosynth Hackathon and the Allen Brain Atlas Hackathon) and providing reserved time for broad scientific inquiry (e.g., Brainhack), to using specific challenges that focus hacking activity (e.g., HBM Hackathon).\\nThere has been an emergence of \\'datathons\\' or data-focused hackathons in recent years. These events challenge data scientists working with others attending to together use creativity and data analysis skills and platforms to build, test and explore solutions and dashboards which analyse huge datasets in a limited amount of time. These are increasingly being used to deliver insights in big public and private datasets in various disciplines including business, healthcare news media and for social causes.\\n\\n\\n=== Using a specific programming langua...

While organized crime is generally thought of as a form of illegal business, some criminal organizations, such as terrorist groups, rebel forces, and separatists, are politically motivated. Many criminal organizations rely on fear or terror to achieve their goals or aims as well as to maintain control within the organization and may adopt tactics commonly used by authoritarian regimes to maintain power. Some forms of organized crime simply exist to cater towards demand of illegal goods in a state or to facilitate trade of goods and services that may have been banned by a state (such as illegal drugs or firearms). Sometimes, criminal organizations force people to do business with them, such as when a gang extorts protection money from shopkeepers. Street gangs may often be deemed organized crime groups or, under stricter definitions of organized crime, may become disciplined enough to be considered organized. A criminal organization can also be referred to as an outfit, a gang, crime family, mafia, mob, (crime) ring, or syndicate; the network, subculture, and community of criminals involved in organized crime may be referred to as the underworld or gangland. Sociologists sometimes specifically distinguish a \"mafia\" as a type of organized crime group that specializes in the supply of extra-legal protection and quasi-law enforcement. Academic studies of the original \"Mafia\", the Italian Mafia, as well as its American counterpart, generated an economic study of organized crime groups and exerted great influence on studies of the Russian mafia, the Indonesian preman, the Chinese triads, the Hong Kong triads, and the Japanese yakuza.\\nOther organizations—including states, churches, militaries, police forces, and corporations—may sometimes use organized-crime methods to conduct their activities, but their powers derive from their status as formal social institutions. There is a tendency to distinguish \"traditional\" organized crime such as gambling, loan sharking, drug-trafficking, prostitution, and fraud from certain other forms of crime that also usually involve organized or group criminal acts, such as white-collar crime, financial crimes, political crimes, war crimes, state crimes, and treason. This distinction is not always apparent and academics continue to debate the matter. For example, in failed states that can no longer perform basic functions such as education, security, or governance (usually due to fractious violence or to extreme poverty), organized crime, governance, and war sometimes complement each other. The term \"oligarchy\" has been used to describe democratic countries whose political, social, and economic institutions come under the control of a few families and business oligarchs that may be deemed or may devolve into organized crime groups in practice. By their very nature, kleptocracies, mafia states, narco-states or narcokleptocracies, and states with high levels of clientelism and political corruption are either heavily involved with organized crime or tend to foster organized crime within their own governments.\\nIn the United States, the Organized Crime Control Act (1970) defines organized crime as \"[t]he unlawful activities of [...] a highly organized, disciplined association [...]\". Criminal activity as a structured process is referred to as racketeering. In the UK, police estimate that organized crime involves up to 38,000 people operating in 6,000 various groups. Historically, the largest organized crime force in the United States has been Cosa Nostra (Italian-American Mafia), but other transnational criminal organizations have also risen in prominence in recent decades. A 2012 article in a U.S. Department of Justice journal stated that: \"Since the end of the Cold War, organized crime groups from Russia, China, Italy, Nigeria, and Japan have increased their international presence and worldwide networks or have become involved in more transnational criminal activities. Most of the world\\'s major international organized crime groups are present in the United States.\" The US Drug Enforcement Administration\\'s 2017 National Drug Threat Assessment classified Mexican transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) as the \"greatest criminal drug threat to the United States,\" citing their dominance \"over large regions in Mexico used for the cultivation, production, importation, and transportation of illicit drugs\" and identifying the Sinaloa, Jalisco New Generation, Juárez, Gulf, Los Zetas, and Beltrán-Leyva cartels as the six Mexican TCO with the greatest influence in drug trafficking to the United States. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 16 has a target to combat all forms of organized crime as part of the 2030 Agenda.\\nIn some countries, football hooliganism has been linked to organized crime.\\n\\n\\n== Models of organized crime ==\\nVarious models have been proposed to describe the structure of criminal organizations.\\n\\n\\n=== Organizational ===\\n\\n\\n==== Patron–client networks ====\\nPatron–client networks are defined by fluid interactions. They produce crime groups that operate as smaller units within the overall network, and as such tend towards valuing significant others, familiarity of social and economic environments, or tradition. These networks are usually composed of:\\n\\nHierarchies based on \\'naturally\\' forming family, social and cultural traditions;\\n\\'Tight-knit\\' focus of activity/labor;\\nFraternal or nepotistic value systems;\\nPersonalized activity; including family rivalries, territorial disputes, recruitment and training of family members, etc.;\\nEntrenched belief systems, reliance of tradition (including religion, family values, cultural expectations, class politics, gender roles, etc.); and,\\nCommunication and rule enforcement mechanisms dependent on organizational structure, social etiquette, history of criminal involvement, and collective decision-making.\\n\\n\\n==== Bureaucratic/corporate operations ====\\nBureaucratic/corporate organized crime groups are defined by the general rigidity of their internal structures. They focus more on how the operations works, succeeds, sustains itself or avoids retribution, they are generally typified by:\\n\\nA complex authority structure;\\nAn extensive division of labor between classes within the organization;\\nMeritocratic (as opposed to cultural or social attributes);\\nResponsibilities carried out in an impersonal manner;\\nExtensive written rules/regulations (as opposed to cultural praxis dictating action); and,\\n\\'Top-down\\' communication and rule enforcement mechanisms.\\nHowever, this model of operation has some flaws:\\n\\nThe \\'top-down\\' communication strategy is susceptible to interception, more so further down the hierarchy being communicated to;\\nMaintaining written records jeopardizes the security of the organization and relies on increased security measures;\\nInfiltration at lower levels in the hierarchy can jeopardize the entire organization (a \\'house of cards\\' effect); and,\\nDeath, injury, incarceration or internal power struggles dramatically heighten the insecurity of operations.\\nWhile bureaucratic operations emphasize business processes and strongly authoritarian hierarchies, these are based on enforcing power relationships rather than an overlying aim of protectionism, sustainability or growth.\\n\\n\\n==== Youth and street gangs ====\\n \\n\\nAn estimate on youth street gangs in the United States provided by Hannigan, et al., marked an increase of 35% between 2002 and 2010. A distinctive gang culture underpins many, but not all, organized groups; this may develop through recruiting strategies, social learning processes in the corrective system experienced by youth, family or peer involvement in crime, and the coercive actions of criminal authority figures. The term \"street gang\" is commonly used interchangeably with \"youth gang,\" referring to neighborhoo...

Ahuja as Innovative Scheduling, Inc. The company headquarters is situated on 10 acres in Dallas, Texas, and additional offices are located in Yerevan, Armenia; Bangalore, India; and Perth, Australia.\\nOptym provides transportation software and specializes in the optimization, simulation and analytics of transportation and logistics for railroad, trucking, airline and mining industries. The company clients include 5 of the top 10 LTL carriers and several other clients across railroad, air freight, and full-truckload such as Southwest Airlines, Komatsu, BNSF Railway, BHP, Norfolk Southern, Greyhound, and more.  \\nOptym was founded by researcher and academic Dr. Ravindra K. Ahuja in 2000 as Innovative Scheduling, Inc., which rebranded as Optym in 2014.\\nBetween 2004 and 2015, Optym was located at the Gainesville Technology Entrepreneurship Center (GTEC), a Santa Fe College-led business incubator. In 2015, the company moved its facility to the three-building Hillside Office Park off Tower Road in order to foster rapid expansion and hiring.\\n\\n\\n== Financing ==\\nOptym obtained its first Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant of $500,000 from the National Science Foundation (NSF) in 2004 to develop commercial software, specifically to build a decision support system addressing railroad blocking problems for CSX Transportation. It allowed Optym to hire its first set of full-time employees, including Krishna C. Jha, Wei Huang and Arvind Kumar, all of whom completed their Ph.D.’s at the University of Florida under Ahuja\\'s guidance.\\nIn 2005, Optym received its Phase II SBIR grant to build a decision support system for train\\nscheduling, and BNSF Railway provided a matching grant. These two grants, plus the  licensing revenues from the product funded by the first NSF grant, provided continued funding for the research and development of optimization technologies for railroads. That year, Optym began building and commercializing its software and investing profits into the research and development of new products.\\n\\n\\n== Expansion ==\\nOptym\\'s Armenia office opened in 2007 in the capital city of Yerevan with the goal of conducting research and development of innovative IT techniques. This allowed Optym to package optimization and simulation engines into desktop, web and map-based applications.

It emerged from discussions between Donald Trump and Elon Musk, and was established by executive order on January 20, 2025. DOGE\\'s actions have included accessing government data systems; organizing mass layoffs of federal workers; and cutting climate change initiatives, scientific research, and DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) programs. The initiative has targeted federal agencies including the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), Department of Education, Social Security Administration (SSA), and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).\\nMusk\\'s role within DOGE is unclear. The White House has denied, in media and in courts, that Musk is running DOGE and that he is making government decisions; it asserted that he was only a senior advisor to the president. Trump insists that Musk is the head of DOGE, and courts have declared that he must be its de facto leader. Formerly known as the U.S. Digital Service, \"USDS\" now abbreviates U.S. DOGE Service and comprises the U.S. DOGE Service Temporary Organization (USDSTO), which is scheduled to be dissolved on July 4, 2026, the country\\'s 250th anniversary. The acting administrator of USDS and USDSTO has been named by the White House as Amy Gleason, not Musk.\\nDOGE has been met with opposition and lawsuits. A federal judge found that Musk\\'s role likely violates the Appointments Clause, and legal experts have warned of a constitutional crisis. Democratic Party members have challenged DOGE\\'s authority, with some calling its actions a \"coup\". Musk did not divest from companies that are receiving billions in government contracts and are clashing with federal regulators DOGE is trying to slash, creating potential conflicts of interest. Musk has promised transparency while Trump has tried to exempt DOGE from public disclosure rules. The White House has said that DOGE complies with federal law, and that Musk would \"excuse himself\" if DOGE activities conflicted with his business interests.\\nMusk has stated a goal of cutting $1 trillion, or about 15% of the federal budget. As of March 24, 2025, DOGE has claimed to have saved $130 billion. Independent analysis has found that DOGE\\'s reports misaccounted tens of billions of dollars, with more than a third of canceled contracts already obligated or yielding no savings. Musk, DOGE, and the Trump administration have made multiple claims of having discovered significant fraud, none of which have held up under scrutiny. According to watchdogs, DOGE is redefining fraud to target federal employees and programs to build political support for their cuts; former Republican budget experts said DOGE cuts were driven by political ideology more than frugality. Despite widespread criticism, Trump has reiterated his support for Musk and DOGE.\\n\\n\\n== Definition ==\\nAmy Gleason identifies three meanings of the term DOGE:\\n\\nThe U.S. DOGE Service, of which Gleason is acting administrator\\nEmbedded agency DOGE teams, which are under the employ of each government agency\\nThe DOGE policy agenda, on which Elon Musk advises Trump\\nIn spite of the name, DOGE is not a cabinet-level department. In court, DOGE has argued that it is not a government agency; a federal judge found that it is an agency.\\n\\n\\n== Background ==\\nStarting in 2023, Musk has financially backed Trump and other Republicans, becoming the largest individual donor of the 2024 election cycle after spending more than US$290 million in campaign contributions. In September 2024, Musk described deregulation as the only path to his Mars colonization program. In his November 2024 Tucker Carlson interview, he admitted: \"If Trump loses, I\\'m fucked\".\\nOn September 5, 2024, Trump promised to the Economic Club of New York: \"at the suggestion of Elon Musk [...] I will create a Government Efficiency Commission tasked with conducting a complete financial and performance audit of the entire federal government and making recommendations for drastic reforms.\" Javier Milei revealed that, prior to the public declaration, Musk had called Federico Sturzenegger to discuss emulating his ministry\\'s deregulation model in the United States.\\nThe New York Times compared the project to Theodore Roosevelt\\'s Keep Commission, Ronald Reagan\\'s Grace Commission, and vice president Al Gore\\'s National Partnership for Reinventing Government.\\n\\n\\n=== Emergence ===\\nThe project emerged from a discussion in the summer of 2024 between Musk and Trump, where Musk floated the idea of a \"government efficiency commission\". In an August 18 interview to Reuters after a campaign event, Trump said that, if elected, he would be open to giving Musk an advisory role. The next day, an X user suggested \"Department of Government Efficiency\"; Musk replied \"That is the perfect name\", and posted \"I am willing to serve\" with an AI-created image of him in front of a lectern marked \"D.O.G.E.\" The DOGE acronym refers to an internet meme and to Dogecoin, a meme coin that Musk promotes.\\nOn October 27, at a Trump campaign rally in Madison Square Garden, Musk said he thought DOGE could reduce federal spending by \"at least\" $2 trillion, a figure higher than the 2023 discretionary spending budget. On November 1, Musk mentioned that Ron Paul could work with DOGE; Paul vowed to join; they agreed on cutting military spending; this led nowhere.\\nDays after the election, a small group, including Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy, Howard Lutnick, and Brad Smith, started meeting at Mar-a-Lago. On November 12, Trump announced that Musk and Ramaswamy would lead DOGE and analogized it to the Manhattan Project. During an interview with Tucker Carlson on the same day, Musk proposed consolidating the 400 federal agencies: \"99 [...] is more than enough\". On November 17, Ramaswamy stated that DOGE may eliminate entire agencies and reduce the federal workforce by 75%.\\nOn January 2, 2025, Musk posited that DOGE had a good shot at cutting $1 trillion, but that $2 trillion was the best-case scenario. At the first cabinet meeting of the second Trump administration in February, Musk remained optimistic that $1 trillion–15% of the budget–could be cut.\\n\\n\\n=== Self-deletion date ===\\nOn December 2, 2024, Ramaswamy posted that \"Most government projects should come with a clear expiry date\"; Musk replied that the final step of DOGE was \"to delete itself\". Trump stated that the entity\\'s work will \"conclude\" no later than July 4, 2026. This termination will coincide with a \"Great American Fair\" that Trump has proposed on the 250th anniversary of the United States. Trump called the promised results \"the perfect gift to America\".\\nTrump\\'s January 20 order on DOGE (E.O. 14158) created and divided DOGE into a permanent part and a temporary part. What exactly the temporary part consists of has yet to be determined. Trump\\'s February 26 DOGE executive order (E.O. 14222) does not stipulate any termination date.\\n\\n\\n=== Ramaswamy steps away ===\\nOn January 19, 2025, CBS News reported that Ramaswamy would step away from DOGE and instead run for Ohio governorship; it also reports internal friction between Ramaswamy and Musk, with Musk\\'s supporters \"privately undercutting\" Ramaswamy for his perceived lack of engagement. A Republican strategist has confided that Ramaswamy was wanted out of D.C. after his post on how Americans \"venerated mediocrity over excellence\". On January 20, following the second presidential inauguration of Trump, the White House confirmed that Ramaswamy would not join DOGE. On January 27, Ramaswamy denied being ousted and announced his resignation, contrasting his focus on \"constitutional law, legislative-based approach\" and Musk\\'s \"technology approach, which is the future approach\".\\n\\n\\n=== Early fraud claims ===\\nIn his November 12, 2024, announcement, Trump stated that DOGE will work with the Office ...

It consists of the protection of computer software, systems and networks from threats that can lead to unauthorized information disclosure, theft or damage to hardware, software, or data, as well as from the disruption or misdirection of the services they provide.\\nThe significance of the field stems from the expanded reliance on computer systems, the Internet, and wireless network standards. Its importance is further amplified by the growth of smart devices, including smartphones, televisions, and the various devices that constitute the Internet of things (IoT). Cybersecurity has emerged as one of the most significant new challenges facing the contemporary world, due to both the complexity of information systems and the societies they support. Security is particularly crucial for systems that govern large-scale systems with far-reaching physical effects, such as power distribution, elections, and finance.\\nAlthough many aspects of computer security involve digital security, such as electronic passwords and encryption, physical security measures such as metal locks are still used to prevent unauthorized tampering. IT security is not a perfect subset of information security, therefore does not  completely align into the security convergence schema.\\n\\n\\n== Vulnerabilities and attacks ==\\n\\nA vulnerability refers to a flaw in the structure, execution, functioning, or internal oversight of a computer or system that compromises its security. Most of the vulnerabilities that have been discovered are documented in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database. An exploitable vulnerability is one for which at least one working attack or exploit exists. Actors maliciously seeking vulnerabilities are known as threats. Vulnerabilities can be researched, reverse-engineered, hunted, or exploited using automated tools or customized scripts.\\nVarious people or parties are vulnerable to cyber attacks; however, different groups are likely to experience different types of attacks more than others.\\nIn April 2023, the United Kingdom Department for Science, Innovation & Technology released a report on cyber attacks over the previous 12 months. They surveyed 2,263 UK businesses, 1,174 UK registered charities, and 554 education institutions. The research found that \"32% of businesses and 24% of charities overall recall any breaches or attacks from the last 12 months.\" These figures were much higher for \"medium businesses (59%), large businesses (69%), and high-income charities with £500,000 or more in annual income (56%).\" Yet, although medium or large businesses are more often the victims, since larger companies have generally improved their security over the last decade, small and midsize businesses (SMBs) have also become increasingly vulnerable as they often \"do not have advanced tools to defend the business.\" SMBs are most likely to be affected by malware, ransomware, phishing, man-in-the-middle attacks, and Denial-of Service (DoS) Attacks.\\nNormal internet users are most likely to be affected by untargeted cyberattacks. These are where attackers indiscriminately target as many devices, services, or users as possible. They do this using techniques that take advantage of the openness of the Internet. These strategies mostly include phishing, ransomware, water holing and scanning.\\nTo secure a computer system, it is important to understand the attacks that can be made against it, and these threats can typically be classified into one of the following categories:\\n\\n\\n=== Backdoor ===\\nA backdoor in a computer system, a cryptosystem, or an algorithm is any secret method of bypassing normal authentication or security controls. These weaknesses may exist for many reasons, including original design or poor configuration. Due to the nature of backdoors, they are of greater concern to companies and databases as opposed to individuals.\\nBackdoors may be added by an authorized party to allow some legitimate access or by an attacker for malicious reasons. Criminals often use malware to install backdoors, giving them remote administrative access to a system. Once they have access, cybercriminals can \"modify files, steal personal information, install unwanted software, and even take control of the entire computer.\"\\nBackdoors can be difficult to detect, as they often remain hidden within the source code or system firmware intimate knowledge of the operating system of the computer.\\n\\n\\n=== Denial-of-service attack ===\\nDenial-of-service attacks (DoS) are designed to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users. Attackers can deny service to individual victims, such as by deliberately entering a wrong password enough consecutive times to cause the victim\\'s account to be locked, or they may overload the capabilities of a machine or network and block all users at once. While a network attack from a single IP address can be blocked by adding a new firewall rule, many forms of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks are possible, where the attack comes from a large number of points. In this case, defending against these attacks is much more difficult. Such attacks can originate from the zombie computers of a botnet or from a range of other possible techniques, including distributed reflective denial-of-service (DRDoS), where innocent systems are fooled into sending traffic to the victim. With such attacks, the amplification factor makes the attack easier for the attacker because they have to use little bandwidth themselves. To understand why attackers may carry out these attacks, see the \\'attacker motivation\\' section.\\n\\n\\n=== Physical access attacks ===\\n\\nA direct-access attack is when an unauthorized user (an attacker) gains physical access to a computer, most likely to directly copy data from it or steal information. Attackers may also compromise security by making operating system modifications, installing software worms, keyloggers, covert listening devices or using wireless microphones. Even when the system is protected by standard security measures, these may be bypassed by booting another operating system or tool from a CD-ROM or other bootable media. Disk encryption and the Trusted Platform Module standard are designed to prevent these attacks.\\nDirect service attackers are related in concept to direct memory attacks which allow an attacker to gain direct access to a computer\\'s memory. The attacks \"take advantage of a feature of modern computers that allows certain devices, such as external hard drives, graphics cards, or network cards, to access the computer\\'s memory directly.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Eavesdropping ===\\nEavesdropping is the act of surreptitiously listening to a private computer conversation (communication), usually between hosts on a network. It typically occurs when a user connects to a network where traffic is not secured or encrypted and sends sensitive business data to a colleague, which, when listened to by an attacker, could be exploited. Data transmitted across an open network allows an attacker to exploit a vulnerability and intercept it via various methods.\\nUnlike malware, direct-access attacks, or other forms of cyber attacks, eavesdropping attacks are unlikely to negatively affect the performance of networks or devices, making them difficult to notice. In fact, \"the attacker does not need to have any ongoing connection to the software at all. The attacker can insert the software onto a compromised device, perhaps by direct insertion or perhaps by a virus or other malware, and then come back some time later to retrieve any data that is found or trigger the software to send the data at some determined time.\"\\nUsing a virtual private network (VPN), which encrypts data between two points, is one of the most common forms of protection against eavesdropping. Using the best form of encryption possible ...

Duolingo offers courses on 43 languages, ranging from English, French, and Spanish to less commonly studied languages such as Welsh, Irish, and Navajo, and even constructed languages such as Klingon. It also offers courses on music and math. The learning method incorporates gamification to motivate users with points, rewards and interactive lessons featuring spaced repetition. The app promotes short, daily lessons for consistent-phased practice.\\nDuolingo also offers the Duolingo English Test, an online language assessment, and Duolingo ABC, a literacy app designed for children. The company follows a freemium model, with optional premium services like Super Duolingo and Duolingo Max, which are ad-free and provide additional features. Additionally, Duolingo runs Duo\\'s Taqueria, a Mexican taco restaurant in Pittsburgh.\\nWith over 110 million monthly active users, Duolingo is the most popular educational app in the world. Over 10 million people have a Duolingo streak longer than a year. In total, learners on Duolingo complete more than 13 billion exercises per week. A systematic review of research on Duolingo from 2012 to 2020 found comparatively few studies on the platform\\'s efficiency for language learning but identified several studies that reported relatively high user satisfaction, enjoyment, and positive perceptions of the app\\'s effectiveness. The company has also been recognized for its successful marketing tactics and strong brand engagement.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early history ===\\nThe idea of Duolingo was formulated in 2009 by Carnegie Mellon University professor Luis von Ahn and his Swiss-born post-graduate student Severin Hacker. Von Ahn had sold his second company, reCAPTCHA, to Google and, with Hacker, wanted to work on an education-related project. Von Ahn stated that he saw how expensive it was for people in his community in Guatemala to learn English. Hacker (co-founder and current CTO of Duolingo) believed that \"free education will really change the world\" and wanted to provide an accessible means for doing so. He was recognized by the National Inventors Hall of Fame for his contributions to language learning and technological development. The Duo mascot is a green owl because co-founder Severin Hacker hates the color green.\\nThe project was originally financed by von Ahn\\'s MacArthur fellowship and a National Science Foundation grant. The founders considered creating Duolingo as a nonprofit organization, but von Ahn judged this model unsustainable. Its early revenue stream, a crowdsourced translation service, was replaced by a Duolingo English Test certification program, advertising, and subscription.\\n\\n\\n=== Funds ===\\n\\nIn October 2011, Duolingo announced that it had raised $3.3 million from a Series A round of funding, led by Union Square Ventures, with participation from author Tim Ferriss and actor Ashton Kutcher\\'s investing firm A-Grade Investments. Duolingo launched a private beta on November 30, 2011, and accumulated a waiting list of more than 100,000 people by December 13. It launched to the general public on June 19, 2012, at which point the waiting list had grown to around 500,000.\\nIn September 2012, Duolingo announced that it had raised a further $15 million from a Series B funding round led by New Enterprise Associates, with participation from Union Square Ventures. In November 2012, Duolingo released an iPhone app, followed by an Android app in May 2013, at which time Duolingo had around 3 million users. By July 2013, it had grown to 5 million users and was rated the No. 1 free education app in the Google Play Store.\\nIn February 2014, Duolingo announced that it had raised $20 million from a Series C funding round led by Kleiner Caufield & Byers, with prior investors also participating. At this time, it had 34 employees, and reported about 25 million registered users and 12.5 million active users; it later reported a figure closer to 60 million users.\\nIn June 2015, Duolingo announced that it had raised $45 million from a Series D funding round led by Google Capital, bringing its total funding to $83.3 million. The round valued the company at around $470 million, with 100 million registered users globally. In April 2016, it was reported that Duolingo had more than 18 million monthly users.\\nIn July 2017, Duolingo announced that it had raised $25 million in a Series E funding round led by Drive Capital, bringing its total funding to $108.3 million. The round valued Duolingo at $700 million, and the company reported passing 200 million registered users, with 25 million active users. It was reported that Duolingo had 95 employees. Funds from the Series E round would be directed toward creating initiatives such as a related educational flashcard app, TinyCards, and testbeds for initiatives related to reading and listening comprehension. On August 1, 2018, Duolingo surpassed 300 million registered users.\\nIn December 2019, it was announced that Duolingo raised $30 million in a Series F funding round from Alphabet\\'s investment company, CapitalG. The round valued Duolingo at $1.5 billion. Duolingo reported 30 million active users at this time. The headcount at the company had increased to around two hundred, and new offices had been opened in Seattle, New York, and Beijing. Duolingo planned to use the funds to develop new products and further expand its team in sectors like engineering, business development, design, curriculum and content creators, community outreach, and marketing.\\n\\n\\n=== Features and media ===\\n\\nIn October 2013, Duolingo launched a crowdsourced language incubator. In March 2021, it announced that it would be ending its volunteer contributor program and donating money to its volunteer contributors who helped develop it. The company said that from now on, language courses would be maintained and developed by professional linguists aligning with CEFR standards. On June 28, 2021, Duolingo filed for an initial public offering on NASDAQ under the ticker DUOL. From August 2021 to June 2022, the Duolingo language learning app was removed from some app stores in China. In the early 2020s, Duolingo was noted for its viral videos on the social media platform TikTok.\\nIn August 2022, Duolingo overhauled its interface, changing its course structure from a tree-like design, where users could choose from a range of lessons after completing previous ones, to a linear progression. This update has been criticized by users across social media outlets, such as Reddit and Twitter. CEO Luis von Ahn stated that there were no plans to reverse the changes—intended to simplify Duolingo for its new users—maintaining both the old and new versions would be difficult. In October 2022, Duolingo acquired Detroit-based animation studio Gunner; it is the studio that produces art assets and animation for Duolingo and Duolingo ABC and its marketing campaigns.\\nIn March 2023, Duolingo officially announced the planned Duolingo Max, a subscription tier above Super Duolingo, in their blog. In July 2023, Duolingo launched a feature using the iOS widget feature. In October 2023, Duolingo released math and music courses in English and Spanish for iOS users.\\nIn 2024, Duolingo made several changes: it replaced some contractor tasks with AI in January, launched the widget feature on Android in March, acquired Detroit-based design studio Hobbes, introduced Friend Streak in August, allowing students to share a streak together with their friends, and released math and music courses for Android in September. During Duocon 2024, Duolingo introduced various new features, including Video Call and mini games called Adventures. In October Duolingo introduced Duolingo Score.\\nIn the fall of 2024, Duolingo started releasing or beta testing new CERF based language courses for learners of English (B2), Spanish (A2), French (A2), Italian (A1), Chinese (A1), J... [content truncated]\\n\\n### Social employee ###\\nA social employee is a worker operating within a social business model. Following an organization\\'s social computing guidelines, social employees use social media tools both for internal workflow and collaboration purposes and for external engagement with customers, prospects and stakeholders through a combination of social media marketing, content marketing, social marketing, and social selling. Social employee programs are considered to be as much about culture and engagement as they are about business processes and best practices. In addition to increased leads and sales, social employee best practices are said to improve business outcomes important to social media marketing, such as increased connections and web traffic, improved brand identification and \"chatter\", and better customer advocacy.\\n\\n\\n== Overview ==\\nThe term \"social employee\" was first introduced to describe those exhibiting the emerging characteristics of workers operating under a social business model.\\nThe term is often used interchangeably with similar designations like \"employee advocate\" or \"social employee advocate\".\\nCrucial to the perceived value of the social employee is the concept of the digital footprint. While organizations are able to generate large bases of followers through social media, research shows that brand marketing and engagement efforts through these networks are not as effective as those of individual employees. In fact, some research indicates that employee experts are more trusted than any other member of an organization. Because of this, social employee programs are designed to train, empower, and support employee engagement efforts in the hopes of authentically engaging larger communities, increasing the frequency of shares, reviews, and other forms of \"earned media\" and expanding the brand\\'s presence on the web.\\n\\n\\n== The personal or employee brand ==\\nA foundational concept of the social employee is the idea of the personal or employee brand. This concept first gained popular attention in a 1997 FastCompany article by business leader Tom Peters titled \"The Brand Called You\". In the article, Peters argued that the premium placed on branding impacted workers\\' lives to such an extent that creating and cultivating a distinct personal brand had become a professional necessity. According to Peters, doing so built trust, loyalty, visibility, influence, and employability.\\nWith increased adoption of social media tools by both businesses and consumers in the early 21st century, many business leaders became increasingly concerned with social engagement, both internally among employees and externally with customers and other stakeholders. While many in the business community acknowledged the potential social tools had for improved collaboration, productivity, and brand messaging, the concern that employees would misrepresent their brand, disclose proprietary information, or otherwise damage their company\\'s reputation or ability to conduct business persisted.\\nAs a result, many began to advocate for employee branding as a solution to this problem. This helped give new meaning to the concept of brand ambassadorship, positioning everyday employees in public, and potentially high-profile, engagement roles.\\n\\n\\n== Characteristics ==\\n\\n\\n=== Engaged ===\\nBecause social employee advocacy is dependent on the perceived authenticity of the employee, engagement is highly valued in social organizations. Further, data show the measurable impact of employee engagement on organizational productivity and profitability:\\n\\nHappy employees were found to be 12 percent more productive.\\nIn one study, engaged employees were found to be 38 percent more likely to produce at above-average rates. In another, organizations with engaged employees had a 19 percent higher than average shareholder return, while organizations with disengaged employees experienced shareholder return that was 44 percent below average.\\nEngaged companies were found to outperform disengaged companies by up to 202 percent.\\nCompanies with strong focus on culture were found to have an average 13.9 percent turnover rate, while those with a low focus experience were found to have a 48.4 percent turnover rate.\\n\\n\\n=== Flexible job environment and work–life balance ===\\nThe number of professionals working mobile or remote has risen considerably since 2010. While estimates vary, one study found that number of organizations with mobile or remote employees is expected to rise from 24 percent in 2012 to 89 percent by 2020. Other research has estimated that by 2020, 105.4 million professionals will work remotely in America, about 72.3 percent of the total workforce.\\nThis change has been linked to a rise in social technologies, including biometrics, wearables, near-field communications, and augmented reality. Social employees have also put a greater emphasis on work–life balance, with many believing that advances in technology can directly support efforts in this area. Purported benefits of this shift include a more flexible workforce, reduced business costs, and greater organizational leverage in attracting and retaining top talent.\\n\\n\\n=== Buys into the brand\\'s story ===\\nIn 2009, thought leader Simon Sinek presented a speech called \"How Great Leaders Inspire Action\" at a TEDxPugetSound event. Sinek\\'s central argument in this speech was, \"People don\\'t buy what you do. They buy why you do it.\" This concept—that the story behind a business or product offering is a more compelling sales tool than the product itself—is frequently cited in social media marketing as a way to build authentic connections with stakeholders. However, others have argued that for employees to share a brand\\'s story authentically, they must be engaged in that story themselves, and as a result, many companies have made storytelling part of their culture programs.\\n\\n\\n=== Collaborative ===\\nAn implicit tenet in social business is that social technologies aren\\'t a barrier to productivity, but rather a path to increased connectivity. The shift in enterprise software systems like IBM Connections to incorporate social communication models, such as mentions, wikis, and newsfeeds, reflects the changing communication dynamics within business. With an increase in diversity and sophistication in collaborative software platforms, social organizations have sought to find new creative ways to utilize these tools and secure employee buy-in around them.\\nCrowdsourcing has also become popular in social businesses. Examples include AT&T\\'s program The Innovation Pipeline (TIP), begun in 2009, which has generated over 28,000 ideas that have led to over 75 projects with funding exceeding $44 million. IBM has also put considerable resources into such processes, producing its social computing guidelines through employee crowdsourcing, as well as its Connections platform through the Technology Adoption Program (TAP), a more formalized crowdsourcing initiative.\\nAnother popular form of internal collaboration is the hack day, or hackathon. Organizations such as Netflix, Facebook, and IBM use hack days to pull employees out of their day-to-day work environments and encourage them to collaborate in nontraditional ways in an attempt to drive disruptive innovation.\\nSocial employees are often encouraged to seek external collaboration opportunities with customers and prospects. For example, Procter & Gamble introduced the Live Well Collaborative to connect with external stakeholders and develop products and services for the 50+ demographic.\\n\\n\\n=== Social listener ===\\nA social listener is someone who engages in social listening, or social media monitoring, for professional means. Social employees can use social media monitoring for a variety of reasons, including professional development, industry news and trends, and gauging market sentiment. Some have argued that social listening is one of the most important components of social business, as it enables organizations to collect rich market data, make more infor...

The term has become associated in popular culture with a security hacker – someone with knowledge of bugs or exploits to break into computer systems and access data which would otherwise be inaccessible to them. In a positive connotation, though, hacking can also be utilized by legitimate figures in legal situations. For example, law enforcement agencies sometimes use hacking techniques to collect evidence on criminals and other malicious actors. This could include using anonymity tools (such as a VPN or the dark web) to mask their identities online and pose as criminals.\\nHacking can also have a broader sense of any roundabout solution to a problem, or programming and hardware development in general, and hacker culture has spread the term\\'s broader usage to the general public even outside the profession or hobby of electronics (see life hack).\\n\\n\\n== Definitions ==\\n\\nReflecting the two types of hackers, there are two definitions of the word \"hacker\":\\n\\nOriginally, hacker simply meant advanced computer technology enthusiast (both hardware and software) and adherent of programming subculture; see hacker culture.\\nSomeone who is able to subvert computer security. If doing so for malicious purposes, the person can also be called a cracker.\\nMainstream usage of \"hacker\" mostly refers to computer criminals, due to the mass media usage of the word since the 1990s. This includes what hacker jargon calls script kiddies, less skilled criminals who rely on tools written by others with very little knowledge about the way they work. This usage has become so predominant that the general public is largely unaware that different meanings exist. Though the self-designation of hobbyists as hackers is generally acknowledged and accepted by computer security hackers, people from the programming subculture consider the computer intrusion related usage incorrect, and emphasize the difference between the two by calling security breakers \"crackers\" (analogous to a safecracker).\\nThe controversy is usually based on the assertion that the term originally meant someone messing about with something in a positive sense, that is, using playful cleverness to achieve a goal. But then, it is supposed, the meaning of the term shifted over the decades and came to refer to computer criminals.\\nAs the security-related usage has spread more widely, the original meaning has become less known. In popular usage and in the media, \"computer intruders\" or \"computer criminals\" is the exclusive meaning of the word. In computer enthusiast and hacker culture, the primary meaning is a complimentary description for a particularly brilliant programmer or technical expert. A large segment of the technical community insist the latter is the correct usage, as in the Jargon File definition.\\nSometimes, \"hacker\" is simply used synonymously with \"geek\": \"A true hacker is not a group person. He\\'s a person who loves to stay up all night, he and the machine in a love-hate relationship... They\\'re kids who tended to be brilliant but not very interested in conventional goals It\\'s a term of derision and also the ultimate compliment.\"\\nFred Shapiro thinks that \"the common theory that \\'hacker\\' originally was a benign term and the malicious connotations of the word were a later perversion is untrue.\" He found that the malicious connotations were already present at MIT in 1963 (quoting The Tech, an MIT student newspaper), and at that time referred to unauthorized users of the telephone network, that is, the phreaker movement that developed into the computer security hacker subculture of today.\\n\\n\\n=== Civic hacker ===\\n\\nCivic hackers use their security and programming acumens to create solutions, often public and open-sourced, addressing challenges relevant to neighborhoods, cities, states or countries and the infrastructure within them. Municipalities and major government agencies such as NASA have been known to host hackathons or promote a specific date as a \"National Day of Civic Hacking\" to encourage participation from civic hackers. Civic hackers, though often operating autonomously and independently, may work alongside or in coordination with certain aspects of government or local infrastructure such as trains and buses. For example, in 2008, Philadelphia-based civic hacker William Entriken developed a web application that displayed a comparison of the actual arrival times of local SEPTA trains to their scheduled times after being reportedly frustrated by the discrepancy.\\n\\n\\n=== Security related hacking ===\\nSecurity hackers are people involved with circumvention of computer security. There are several types, including:\\n\\nWhite hat\\nHackers who work to keep data safe from other hackers by finding system vulnerabilities that can be mitigated. White hats are usually employed by the target system\\'s owner and are typically paid (sometimes quite well) for their work. Their work is not illegal because it is done with the system owner\\'s consent.\\nBlack hat or Cracker\\nHackers with malicious intentions. They often steal, exploit, and sell data, and are usually motivated by personal gain. Their work is usually illegal. A cracker is like a black hat hacker, but is specifically someone who is very skilled and tries via hacking to make profits or to benefit, not just to vandalize. Crackers find exploits for system vulnerabilities and often use them to their advantage by either selling the fix to the system owner or selling the exploit to other black hat hackers, who in turn use it to steal information or gain royalties.\\nGrey hat\\nComputer security experts who may sometimes violate laws or typical ethical standards, but do not have the malicious intent typical of a black hat hacker.\\n\\n\\n=== Hacker culture ===\\n\\nHacker culture is an idea derived from a community of enthusiast computer programmers and systems designers in the 1960s around the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\\'s (MIT\\'s) Tech Model Railroad Club (TMRC) and the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. The concept expanded to the hobbyist home computing community, focusing on hardware in the late 1970s (e.g. the Homebrew Computer Club) and on software (video games, software cracking, the demoscene) in the 1980s/1990s. Later, this would go on to encompass many new definitions such as art, and life hacking.\\n\\n\\n== Motives ==\\nFour primary motives have been proposed as possibilities for why hackers attempt to break into computers and networks. First, there is a criminal financial gain to be had when hacking systems with the specific purpose of stealing credit card numbers or manipulating banking systems. Second, many hackers thrive off of increasing their reputation within the hacker subculture and will leave their handles on websites they defaced or leave some other evidence as proof that they were involved in a specific hack. Third, corporate espionage allows companies to acquire information on products or services that can be stolen or used as leverage within the marketplace. Lastly, state-sponsored attacks provide nation states with both wartime and intelligence collection options conducted on, in, or through cyberspace.\\n\\n\\n== Overlaps and differences ==\\n\\nThe main basic difference between programmer subculture and computer security hacker is their mostly separate historical origin and development. However, the Jargon File reports that considerable overlap existed for the early phreaking at the beginning of the 1970s. An article from MIT\\'s student paper The Tech used the term hacker in this context already in 1963 in its pejorative meaning for someone messing with the phone system. The overlap quickly started to break when people joined in the activity who did it in a less responsible way. This was the case after the publication of an article exposing the activities of Draper and Engressia.\\nAccording to Raymond, hackers from the programmer subculture usually work openly and use their real ...

Started in 2015, Junction grew to be one of the largest organizers in Europe. In 2018 it expanded globally with a Junction event at Tsinghua University in China with cooperation from Chinese and South Korean universities bringing high performing students to attend the event in Helsinki.\\nOver the course of the years Junction introduced various formats of events to its public, the biggest one being their yearly Junction Hackathon. This event brings together developers, designers, and entrepreneurs from around the world and helps them build solutions to real world challenges from local and multinational companies.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Junction 2015 ===\\nJunction was first launched in 2015. The event was held on November 6-8th in Kattilahalli, Helsinki and gathered more than 550 participants and resulted in 145 different projects. Notable partners included Uber, Finnair, Supercell, Reaktor, and others.\\nThe winner Junction 2015 was Slush Smackdown, from the Supercell Unlimited track. The team created a game where the players program their own boxer who then competes against other players\\' codes in real-time. It also won the whole Slush Hacks -hackathon competition main prize, worth 20 000 EUR.\\n\\n\\n=== Junction 2016 ===\\nJunction 2016 was held on November 25–27 in Wanha Satama, in Katajanokka, Helsinki, Finland. About 1300 participants from over 77 nationalities attended the hackathon. Partners included Supercell, Zalando, the European Space Agency, General Electric, Sitra, Tieto, UPM  and others.\\nThe teams had 48 hours to develop their ideas and afterwards demo them to other attendants and judges. The main prize for the winning idea of the 2016 event was 20 000 EUR, and many companies offered their own bounties for solving challenges in a specific way or using pre-specified technology. Teams were provided a number of different API\\'s and other emerging technologies to develop their concepts including Oculus Rifts, HTC Vives, Apple Watches, 3D-printers, Microsoft Hololens, and Estimote Beacons among others.\\nThe winner team was suju.online, who created a tool for event organizers and public transportation decision makers that allows them to design dynamic routing for the self-driving bus. The team originated from the local Aalto University and the hack was part of the Future of Mobility track.\\n\\n\\n=== Junction 2017 ===\\nJunction 2017 was held on November 24–26 in Dipoli, the main building of the Otaniemi campus of Aalto University. About 1500 participants from over 90 nationalities attended the hackathon.

It is owned by the non-profit foundation Startup Säätiö, but gathers all of its funding from the partnership contracts between its partner companies.\\n\\n\\n== Other notable hackathon events ==\\nHackMIT\\nLA Hacks\\nMHacks\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n### Hackathon ###\\nA hackathon (also known as a hack day, hackfest, datathon or codefest; a portmanteau of hacking and marathon) is an event where people engage in rapid and collaborative engineering over a relatively short period of time such as 24 or 48 hours. They are often run using agile software development practices, such as sprint-like design wherein computer programmers and others involved in software development, including graphic designers, interface designers, product managers, domain experts, and others collaborate intensively on engineering projects, such as software engineering.\\nThe goal of a hackathon is to create functioning software or hardware by the end of the event. Hackathons tend to have a specific focus, which can include the programming language used, the operating system, an application, an API, or the subject and the demographic group of the programmers. In other cases, there is no restriction on the type of software being created or the design of the new system.\\nIn addition to creating functional software or hardware, hackathons can help participants develop skills like problem solving, critical thinking, creativity, team work, communication and time management. Hackathons can also lead to formation of new companies, finding innovative solutions to real-world problems, or building a community around particular technology or cause.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\nThe word \"hackathon\" is a portmanteau of the words \"hack\" and \"marathon\", where \"hack\" is used in the sense of exploratory programming, not its alternate meaning as a reference to breaching computer security.\\nOpenBSD\\'s apparent first use of the term referred to a cryptographic development event held in Calgary on June 4, 1999, where ten developers came together to avoid legal problems caused due to export regulations of cryptographic software from the United States. Since then, a further three to six events per year have occurred around the world to advance development, generally on university campuses.\\nFor Sun Microsystems, the usage referred to an event at the JavaOne conference from June 15 to June 19, 1999; there John Gage challenged attendees to write a program in Java for the new Palm V using the infrared port to communicate with other people who are using Palm and register it on the Internet.\\nStarting in the mid to late 2000s, hackathons became significantly more widespread and began to be increasingly viewed by companies and venture capitalists as a way to quickly develop new software technologies, and to locate new areas for innovation and funding. Some major companies were born from these hackathons, such as GroupMe, which began as a project at a hackathon at the TechCrunch Disrupt 2010 conference; in 2011 it was acquired by Skype for $85 million. The software PhoneGap began as a project at the iPhoneDevCamp (later renamed iOSDevCamp) in 2008; the company whose engineers developed PhoneGap, Nitobi, refocused itself around PhoneGap, and Nitobi was bought by Adobe in 2011 for an undisclosed amount.\\n\\n\\n== Structure ==\\nHackathons typically start with communication via a presentation or a web page from the hosting organization that mentions the objectives, terms, and details of the hackathon. Developers register to participate in the hackathon and are qualified after the organization screens their background and skills.\\nWhen the hackathon event begins, the participating individuals or teams start their programming work. The administrator of the hackathon is typically able to answer questions and offer help when their issues come up in the event.\\nHackathons can last several hours to several days. For hackathons that last 24 hours or longer, especially competitive ones, eating is often informal, with participants often subsisting on food like pizza and energy drinks. Sometimes sleeping is informal as well, with participants sleeping on-site with sleeping bags.\\nAt the end of hackathons, there are usually a series of demonstrations in which each group presents their results. To capture the great ideas and work-in-progress often people post a video of the demonstrations, blog about results with screenshots and details, share links and progress on social media, suggest a place for open source code and generally make it possible for people to share, learn from and possibly build from the ideas generated and initial work completed.\\nThere is sometimes a contest element as well, in which a panel of judges select the winning teams, and prizes are given. At many hackathons, the judges are made up of organisers and sponsors. At BarCamp-style hackathons, that are organised by the development community, such as iOSDevCamp, the judges are usually made up of peers and colleagues in the field. Such prizes are sometimes a substantial amount of money: a social gaming hackathon at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference offered $250,000 in funding to the winners, while a controversial 2013 hackathon run by Salesforce.com had a payout of $1 million to the winners, billed as the largest-ever prize.\\n\\n\\n== Types of hackathons ==\\n\\n\\n=== For an application type ===\\nSome hackathons focus on a particular platform such as mobile apps, a desktop operating system, web development or video game development.\\nMobile app hackathons like Over the Air, held at Phoenix Park, Ireland, can see a large amount of corporate sponsorship and interest.\\nMusic Hack Day, a hackathon for music-related software and hardware applications, is a popular event, having been held over 30 times around the world since 2009. Also Music Tech Fest, a three-day interdisciplinary festival for music ideas bringing together musicians with hackers, researchers and industry, features a hackathon. Similarly, Science Hack Day, a hackathon for making things with science, has been held over 45 times in over 15 countries around the world since 2010.\\nHackathons have been held to develop applications that run on various mobile device operating systems, such as Android, iOS and MeeGo. Hackathons have also been held to develop video-based applications and computer games. Hackathons where video games are developed are sometimes called game jams.\\n\"TV Hackfest\" events have been held in both London and San Francisco, focusing mainly on social television and second screen technologies. In TV Hackfests, challenge briefs are typically submitted by content producers and brands, in the form of broadcast industry metadata or video content, while sponsors supply APIs, SDKs and pre-existing open source software code.\\nHackathons have also been used in the life sciences to advance the informatics infrastructure that supports research. The Open Bioinformatics Foundation ran two hackathons for its member projects in 2002 and 2003, and since 2010 has held 2-day \"codefests\" preceding its annual conference. The National Evolutionary Synthesis Center has co-organized and sponsored hackathons for evolutionary bioinformatics since 2006.  BioHackathon is an annual event that started in 2008 targeted at advancing standards to enable interoperable bioinformatics tools and Web services. Neuroscientists have also used hackathons to bring developers and scientists together to address issues that range from focusing on a specific information system (e.g., Neurosynth Hackathon and the Allen Brain Atlas Hackathon) and providing reserved time for broad scientific inquiry (e.g., Brainhack), to using specific challenges that focus hacking activity (e.g., HBM Hackathon).\\nThere has been an emergence of \\'datathons\\' or data-focused hackathons in recent years. These events challenge data scientists working with others attending to together use creativity and data analysis skills and platforms to build, test and explore solutions and dashboards which analyse huge datasets in a limited amount of time. These are increasingly being used to deliver insights in big public and private datasets in various disciplines including business, healthcare news media and for social causes.\\n\\n\\n=== Using a specific programming langua...
